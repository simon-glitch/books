# books
This is where I author my own books. I like being creative I guess :)

I am planning on writing a few specific books. For now, those are:

## The Beautiful Rayrime
A story about a woman, who, according to her opinion of herself, is too beautiful.
* She feels like she has to dress and behave in certain particular ways just because she is "too beautiful"..

## The Angel of Antilight
A story about the inevitable existence, reality bending angel of antilight, Pampou.
* Pampou is the most powerful being in the multiverse, in terms of raw "power", but that doesn't mean that everything is easy for him.
* This story focuses on how reality is not the same as what we perceive it to be and how there is always more complexity to discover in everything we experience.
