# books
This is where I author my own books. I like being creative I guess :)

I am planning on writing a few specific books. For now, those are:

## The Beautiful Rayrime
A story about a woman, who, according to her opinion of herself, is too beautiful.
* She feels like she has to dress and behave in certain particular ways just because she is "too beautiful".
* This story is super **chill**.
* It's mainly composed of Rayrime's everyday activities.
* It also (of course) focuses on Rayrime's character development, which is sometimes sudden, and sometimes gradual (slow). This is intended to reflect how personal character development works in real life.
* Obviously though, this is just a story, and I am telling it from a perspective that I can't really empathize with very well.
  * The whole point of writing the story is for me to, welp, practice the act of empathizing with people that are not similar to me.
  * Also, I think the story just sounds like a fun idea.
  * I can write whatever I want to, and do so *however* I want to. **BUT**, I would love some advice on this, if you have any.

## The Angel of Antilight
A story about the inevitable existence, reality bending angel of antilight, Pampou.
* Pampou is the most powerful being in the multiverse, in terms of raw "power", but that doesn't mean that everything is easy for him.
* This story focuses on how reality is not the same as what we perceive it to be and how there is always more complexity to discover in everything we experience.
