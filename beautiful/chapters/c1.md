### Rayrime always eats alone
"Hey Rayrime, why do you always seem to be so lonely?"

"Hey Qiamal, why are you asking such a sensitive question?!"

Rayrime sounded stressed when she said this and was clearly close to stuttering. She was afraid that Qiamal would realize how pretty she was and start trying to "reel her in".

"Well, im kinda worried about you. However, you also seem to want to be lonely, considering how you eat lunch alone."

"No. Im just a werewolf, that's all. You see, werewolves prefer to eat food alone, since they don't want to risk allowing others to eat their food."

"Rayrime, was that some kind of joke? It wasnt funny at all. What is more funny is the fact that you said something so absurd. I dont want to laugh at you, because i dont want to hurt your feelings; but, you are practically asking to be laughed at."

"Qiamal, you such a rude pile of rubbish trash!!!" Rayrime shouted. She knew this wasn't true, but she wanted Qiamal to stop pressuring her like this.
* "... leave me alone" Rayrime said softly.

It was clear to Qiamal that Rayrime was becoming an emotional mess. So, he wanted to help.
* "Fine. I will leave Rayrime the werewolf alone. But i still need to accomodate Rayrime the human." Qiamal stated proudly while puffing out his chest.

Rayrime then said: "Great, your puffing your chest out like a human. We are both just acting like animals at this point ..."
* *slurp*
* *munch*
* *chew chew*
* "ugh. I guess i should be civilised and allow other people to eat lunch with me, if they want to."

"Yeah. I heard my buddy Logan tell me about what you said yesterday. You told him that if he sat next to you, you would make a scene and tell a professor that he got turned on by your beauty and decided to molest you."

"Ohhh; good idea! I could make you get the hail away from me too."

"Rayrime, im not going to molest you --"

"You sure?!?!" It was at this point in time that Rayrime started pulling up her shirt. It only took 0.5 seconds for Qiamal to see her belly button. Qiamal has watched enough romance movies to know what will happen next if he keeps looking her way. So, he tried to jump out of his seat, unfortunately for him, the table was in his way. He ended up tripping and falling on his face. The table was at least sturdy enough that no food was spilled, but Qiamal got a bloody nose and scraped both of his elbows.

"Ahh, shight! Qiamal! Why did you do that?!"

"Why did **YOU** do that other thing?!?!" Qiamal turned around and shouted.

"Ha. He. Haha. Hiiiii. That's ... that's kinda funny." Rayrime grinned and laughed at Qiamal.

"Are you a sadist or something?" Qiamal said.

"A sadist? A say disk? S A Y D I S K. Or Acedist? A C E D I S T?" Rayrime was now just asking questions normally, while looking at the bump between Qiamal's legs."

"That's rude... and sadist is spelled S A D I S T." As Qiamal said this, he clumsily changed his posture to hide the bump, and did a gesture with his hands, trying to calm himself down.

"Ok ok ok. Next time, i guess i wont do that. Believe it or not, i dont like seeing you flustered and angry at the same time. Hehe. Even tho i am having a lot of fun just realizing the consequences of the own actions. I should be more uhhh conscious of how my actions affect you, shouldn't I?" Rayrime used her critical thinking skills to think of the right thing to say." Rayrime apologized.

There was a 3 second pause, where Qiamal simply held his eyes closed and continued to calm down. Rayrime simply looked down at him.

Rayrime continued, *quietly* "I'm sorry for knocking over. Here:" Rayrime squated and grabbed Qiamal. She put her left hand on his left hand and her right hand on his left shoulder.

Qiamal said "But someone will see --" with a worried look on his face.

Rayrime immediately corrected him: "No. Ill use myself to obscure you so no one sees anything suspicious. Feel free to put your weight into my arm when i pick you up. I want it to be clear to any onlooker that im simply helping you get up." It helped that the tables were hiding the 2 of them, and thus giving her the time to say all of this. Usually the whole room will subconsciously, relentlessly watch Rayrime. Rayrime is more beautiful than everyone else and very difficult for a person to take their mind off of.

Rayrime picked up Qiamal without any difficulty, and 11 people immediately looked at them. Everyone in the room thought that there might be some kind of commotion. However, thanks to the exact posture that Rayrime had, noone suspected anything and everyone continued behaving as usual. Rayrime made sure to be quick about getting Qiamal into her seat. There were only 2 seats at her table, and Qiamal had already knocked over the other seat. Then, Rayrime picked up the other seat, sat in it, and swapped her food with Qiamal's. She made sure to remind Qiamal of an obviously fact: "Im not a werewolf, but i really dont want you to eat any of my food if you can just eat your own food instead. But, if you are **extra** hungry, i can share some of the extra food~ ~hehe~"
